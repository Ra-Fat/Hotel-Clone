# 🌍 Hotel Booking Website Clone

This is a responsive hotel booking website project built with **React** and **custom CSS**, inspired by the Colorlib "Hotell" template. The goal of the project is to create a clean and modern platform for hotel advertising and booking experiences.

The website is a **collaborative team project**, where each member is responsible for specific components. The design has been cloned and customized to practice real-world teamwork, component-based architecture, and responsive front-end development using React.

## 🧠 React Concepts Used

### 🔹 Props
Used to pass data between components for reusability and flexibility (e.g., passing title or image props into card components).

### 🔹 State (`useState`)
Used to manage interactive UI elements like toggling FAQ answers or controlling form inputs.

### 🔹 Effect (`useEffect`)
Used in components that require actions when they mount, such as loading animations or scroll effects.

### 🔹 Routing
Managed using `react-router-dom` to allow smooth navigation between:
- `/` (Home)
- `/about`
- `/services`
- `/destinations`
- `/contact`
- `/offers`
- And more...
